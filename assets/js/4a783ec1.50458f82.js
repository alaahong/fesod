work on trust rather than unnecessary constraints.\n\nBeing a committer enables you to more easily make \nchanges without needing to go through the patch \nsubmission process.\n\nBeing a committer does not require you to \nparticipate any more than you already do. It does \ntend to make one even more committed.  You will \nprobably find that you spend more time here.\n\nOf course, you can decline and instead remain as a \ncontributor, participating as you do now.\n\nThis personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.\nPlease let us know in reply to this message whether you accept or decline.\n\nIf you accept, you will need an Apache account (id) with privileges.\nPlease follow these instructions.\n\nA.

Instructions for its completion and return to\n    the Secretary of the ASF are found at\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html#submitting\n\n    Do not copy the project or any other individual on your message\n    to Secretary, as the form contains Personally Identifiable Information\n    that should be kept private.\n\n    3. When you complete the ICLA form, be sure to include in the form\n    the Apache [Project] project and choose a\n    unique Apache ID. Look to see if your preferred\n    ID is already taken at\n    https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html\n    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PPMC\n    when your ICLA has been recorded.\n\nWhen recording of your ICLA is noted, you will\nreceive a follow-up message with the next steps for\nestablishing you as a committer.\n\n${NOMINATOR} (as represents of The Apache Fesod (Incubating) PPMC)\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"the-candidate-accepts-the-invitation",children:"The candidate accepts the invitation"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"If the invitation is accepted, the candidate will receive an email from the ASF."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Title:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"Invitation to become Apache Fesod (Incubating) Committer: ${CANDIDATE_NAME}\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Content:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-text",children:"Welcome.
